Jace: Sorry there's no cake.
Clary: Well, i was excpecting nothing, so... this is great.
Jace: Everyone should get something to their birthday.
Clary: What did you get?
Jace: Weapons, mostly. Sure that doesn't surprise you.
Clary: At this point nothing realy does.

Jace: When i was nine, my father gave me a falcon, he told me to make it obedient. I was supose to keep the bird blind, but i.. couldn't bring myself to do it.
       Instead i touched and stocked its wings until it trusted me, i tamed it to perfection. I took it to my father, excpecting him to be proud of what i've done.
       He said: i told you to make it obedient, instead, you taught it to love you. You didn't tame it, you broke it. He took a bird and broke its neck. 
       I cried all night and never cried again.
Clary: Did you ever forgive him?
Jace: He did it to make me stronger.

Clary: Does that stand for Wayland?
Jace: Mhm.
